# project 6 interactive media player

In this project I built an interactive media player web page using a JavaScript video/audio player library. Customized the video player's style a little bit. Also added captions where they will be highlighted as the video plays. You can also click the captions to jump to the corresponding time of the video.

Technologies used:

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript

MediaElement.js (A JavaScript video/audio player library)
